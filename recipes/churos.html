    <h2>Churros (Mexican fritters)</h2>
    <p>A churro is a cinnamon and sugar-topped fried pastry dough stick with Spanish and Portuguese origins. Churros are similar to doughnuts, but they have ridges because they are piped out of a pastry bag. Because they are fried instead of baked, churros have a fluffy and tender interior with a satisfyingly crispy exterior.</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
