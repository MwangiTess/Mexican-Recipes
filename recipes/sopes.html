    <h2>Mexican Sopes</h2>

    <h3>Ingredients for 1 serving</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1<small>1/3 </small>cups masa harina (corn flour)</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons flour</li>
        <li><small>1/2 </small>teaspoon salt</li>
        <li><small>3/4 </small>cup water</li>
        <li>1 egg, beaten</li>
        <li><small>1/4 </small>cup shortening, melted</li>
        <li>2 cups vegetable oil for frying, or as needed</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine masa harina, flour, and salt in a bowl. Stir water and egg into the masa mixture; add melted shortening and mix well to form dough.</li>
        <li>Gently knead dough until moist but retains shape; transfer to a bowl, cover bowl with plastic wrap, and refrigerate for 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Divide chilled dough into 15 portions. Roll 1 portion of dough into a ball, while keeping remaining dough covered to prevent it from drying. On a lightly floured work surface, pat ball into a 3-inch round. Pinch along the edges of the round to make a ridge. Repeat with remaining dough portions.</li>
        <li>Pour enough oil into a skillet to be about 1/2-inch deep; heat to 365 degrees F (185 degrees C). Fry a couple shells in hot oil at a time until crisp, 1 to 2 minutes per side. Remove sopes from oil using a slotted spoon to a plate lined with paper towel. Add more oil as needed and reheat between batches.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Cooks's Notes</h3>
    <p>They can be frozen after being fried. Let sopes cool, then place them in a single layer in an airtight container. Cover and freeze for up to 1 month.</p>
    <p>To reheat, place sopes on baking sheet and bake for 8 to 10 minutes until heated through.</p>
